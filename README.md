# GEN FrameWork

## What is GEN FrameWork?

GEN is a small multiplatform framework for the development of applications in C/C++. The main objective of this framework is above all the portability between different hardware and/or operating systems.

- **It is developed in C/C++** since this language is one of the most supported in the different architectures and platforms, allowing in turn access to resources (memory, peripherals, etc ...) in the fastest and most accessible way possible.

- **It is a generic framework**, is developed to perform any type of application: Utilities, games, libraries, etc ... having great versatility of functions and modules by general use.

- **It is very portable**, being able to be used in multiple compilers and IDEs, both in old and modern versions. This allows great flexibility when making applications: you can program on almost any platform, for practically any platform.
